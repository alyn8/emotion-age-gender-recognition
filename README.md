# 👤 Real-Time Emotion, Age, and Gender Recognition with CNNs

This project presents a Flask-based web application capable of recognizing **emotion**, **age**, and **gender** from human faces using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**. It supports real-time webcam input, image upload, and video file analysis. The trained models are deployed via an intuitive web interface, making it practical for human-computer interaction scenarios.

📊 Model Architecture Overview
A custom CNN with Conv2D, MaxPooling, Dropout, and Dense layers was used for each task, optimized via early stopping and batch normalization.

## 🧠 Models

Three separate CNN models were developed for:

| Task                | Dataset    | Evaluation Metric    | Performance            |
|---------------------|------------|-----------------------|------------------------|
| Emotion Detection   | FER2013    | Accuracy, F1-Score    | ~67.28% Accuracy       |
| Age Estimation      | UTKFace    | MAE, MSE, R² Score    | MAE: 5.98 / R²: 0.82   |
| Gender Classification | UTKFace  | Accuracy, F1-Score    | ~88.9% Accuracy        |
